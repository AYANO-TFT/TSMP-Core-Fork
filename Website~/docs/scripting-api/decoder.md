# `TSMPDecoder`

## Combined byte output

`useCombinedByteOutput` defaults to `true`. In the predicted path, compatible codec shaders write the 56-byte decoded header and payload directly into the private RGBA8 readback target, removing the separate packing pass and intermediate payload write. The immutable source snapshot, header CRC validation, exact-length prediction check and same-snapshot fallback are unchanged. This does not change the wire datagram or guarantee a delivery rate.

Shaders opt in by implementing both `_TSMPHeaderTex` and `_TSMPHeaderPixels`. Existing codecs without these properties keep the separate packing path. The switch is in Diagnostics > Advanced Decode. `combinedByteOutputCount` counts submissions, including predictions later rejected or retried; it is not a received-frame count. `ResetDecodeDiagnostics()` resets it.

`TSMPDecoder` reads a TSMP texture, validates the header, asks the selected codec to recover payload bytes, and applies variable/RPC messages to bound behaviours.

Use this page when wiring a custom receiver, reading diagnostics, or debugging why a frame was ignored.

## Component fields

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sourceTexture` | Texture that contains the encoded TSMP frame. |
| `payloadByteTexture` | Render texture used by codec shaders when decoding payload bytes. |
| `codecHandlers` | Codec components available to the decoder. The header `codecId` selects the handler. |
| `applyEveryFrame` | Runs decode from the component update loop. Disable it when another script calls `DecodeNow()`. |
| `skipDuplicateFrames` | Enables duplicate and older-frame filtering for the current stream. Inspector label: Filter Frames. |
| `frameWindowSize` | Window Size in frames, default 256, minimum effective value 1. Used for the frame-zero restart exception; not a buffer allocation. |
| `flipY` | Flips texture sampling for capture paths that invert the image. |
| `useHeaderPayloadLayout` | Uses header payload metadata to size readback. Keep enabled for normal use. |
| `payloadBytesOverride` | Manual payload byte count for test paths. |
| `decodeSafetyMode` | Extra guards for malformed or partial frames. |
| `usePredictedReadback` | Default true. Use the previous validated configuration to attempt a combined header/payload readback. Manual layout and safety modes bypass it. |
| `useCombinedByteOutput` | Default true. Capable codec shaders write directly to the combined header/payload readback target. |
| `overlapReadbacks` | Default true. Allow up to two independently captured frames in flight; false limits admission to one. |

`TSMPSetup` normally assigns `sourceTexture`, byte textures, codec handlers, and binding arrays.

## Header validation

The decoder rejects a frame before applying payload messages when:

- Magic bytes are not TSMP.
- Header size is not supported.
- Major protocol version is not supported.
- Header CRC does not match.
- Payload size exceeds the available texture layout.

CRC failures are logged as warnings. This helps identify capture corruption without applying bad data.

## `DecodeNow()`

```csharp
public void DecodeNow()
```

Starts decoding one captured frame asynchronously. It is safe to call with `applyEveryFrame` disabled, but the component must remain enabled. With `overlapReadbacks=true` (default), a second frame can start while the first is pending. Calls when both slots are occupied are skipped; no extra image queue is retained. Setting it to false permits only one pending frame. Reentrant calls during result application do not start a capture.

The initial/fallback path performs this order:

1. Copy the current input image into the decoder's snapshot.
2. Read the header pixels from that snapshot.
3. Validate magic, version, payload layout, and CRC.
4. Select a codec handler by `codecId`.
5. Decode payload bytes from the same snapshot.
6. Parse network messages.
7. Apply variables and dispatch RPC calls.

## Predicted readback {#predicted-readback}

After learning a valid header, the decoder can submit a Luma4 header pass and a payload pass using the previous configuration without waiting for the header on the CPU. It packs the decoded bytes into a private linear RGBA8 target and submits one readback. This byte target is separate from the format-preserving input snapshot.

The current header must pass magic, version, size and CRC validation, then the normal frame-order filter. All header bytes before CRC must match the cached header except frame index, timestamp and payload length. Payload length is then checked separately for **exact equality**, and resolved block/sample/start-block settings must match. A length change in either direction, codec/option/stream/layout change or other mismatch discards the speculative payload and requests the actual payload from the **same snapshot**. No second source capture occurs. CRC failure rejects the frame instead of falling back to unchecked data.

Exact-length prediction avoids assuming custom codecs produce the same prefix when asked to decode more bytes. Existing codec interfaces and shaders are unchanged; each pass still calls `PrepareDecode` with its current snapshot. A header must be learned again after disable, source dimension/orientation changes, or use of manual layout/safety modes. Missing packing resources retain the sequential path. The serialized packing material is populated automatically in the Editor/build preparation; ordinary Unity runtime creation also loads the package resource.

Each slot's internal readback buffer contains header bytes `0..55`, then the predicted payload at offset `56`, followed only by row padding. This is **not a wire-format change**. Each slot owns a 14x1 header target and a packed target with width `min(256, ceil((56 + payloadBytes)/4))` and enough rows, four bytes per pixel. Owned targets are reused. On disable, idle resources are released immediately and pending slots are cancelled and released after their callbacks drain. Destruction releases owned targets.

`predictedReadbackCount` counts accepted speculative payloads, not successful RPC executions. `predictionFallbackCount` counts valid-header prediction mismatches that trigger fallback. Both appear in Runtime Status. Duplicate/older frames may already have incurred speculative GPU work, but their payload is not parsed or dispatched. This optimization does not guarantee 60 Hz delivery; measure applications, latency and RPC events independently.

## Input snapshot {#input-snapshot}

No additional Inspector reference or mode is required. Each slot owns a same-size RenderTexture and reuses it between operations. Recognized RGBA/BGRA 8-bit inputs use `ARGB32` with matching linear/sRGB interpretation; RGBA half-float inputs use linear `ARGBHalf`. Float32 and unknown inputs retain linear `ARGBFloat`. Native Unity inspects the graphics format. Udon can inspect RenderTexture format and sRGB state, but other input types conservatively retain Float32. Format changes recreate idle storage. Allocation failures reject the decode and report `lastError`; the decoder never falls back to a changing source image.

Snapshot texel storage per allocated slot is `width * height * bytesPerPixel`, with 4, 8 or 16 bytes for the formats above. Two 8-bit snapshots use about 7.03 MiB at 1280x720 or 63.28 MiB at 3840x2160, 75% less than two Float32 snapshots. These figures exclude other textures and driver overhead. Each accepted attempt still copies the full input once, even if CRC or duplicate checks later reject it. No CPU readback is added. Measure GPU copy cost on deployment hardware.

Changing or destroying `sourceTexture` after capture affects the next operation, not the current image. Disabling cancels all occupied slots, including callbacks delivered after re-enable; a cancelled slot cannot be reused until its request completes. Header, LUT preparation and payload use the same snapshot in both native and Udon paths. Custom codecs must treat the supplied image as read-only and must not retain it as a permanent frame copy. Application is not transactional.

## Bounded readback overlap

`overlapReadbacks` is in Diagnostics > Advanced Decode. Two independently owned slots retain snapshots, prediction metadata, readback buffers and fallback state. Callbacks are routed by request identity in Udon and by separate callbacks in native Unity, not by assumed completion order. Results are processed in capture order: a younger completed result waits for the older slot, including any same-snapshot fallback. The existing frame-order filter and RPC deduplication still run during application. A failed or cancelled head is retired without applying its payload, allowing the next result to proceed.

`readbackInFlight` means at least one captured frame remains pending, including a ready result waiting for its predecessor. `pendingDecodeCount` is 0..2. `skippedBusyDecodeCount` counts capture attempts rejected at the configured capacity, not unique lost video frames, and is reset by `ResetDecodeDiagnostics()`.

The formula above is per slot; its numerical examples already include **two snapshots**. Byte targets and managed buffers require additional memory. Disabling overlap while requests exist stops new admissions until capacity allows; it does not discard accepted frames or immediately free retained slot storage. Overlap trades memory and potentially latency/GPU/CPU load for more capture opportunities. It does not shorten the underlying readback delay, guarantee 60 Hz, recover frames absent from the source texture or provide unlimited buffering.

## Frame window and ordering {#frame-window}

With filtering enabled, compare the incoming index `N` with the last successfully applied index `P` of the current stream. The effective window is `W = max(1, frameWindowSize)`; changing it takes effect on the next header decision.

1. With no previously applied frame, or a different `StreamId`, accept the candidate without an order comparison.
2. If `N == P`, skip the duplicate.
3. Calculate `D = (N - P) modulo 2^32`. If `0 < D < 2^31`, accept it as newer, including natural counter wrap.
4. Otherwise, accept `N == 0` when `P >= W` as an inferred restart.
5. Skip other candidates as older/ambiguous. Exactly half the UInt32 range is ambiguous unless the zero restart exception applies.

Acceptance here permits payload processing, not unconditional application. Only a successful network-frame application advances the remembered stream/index. A corrupt payload, cancelled operation or header/readback-only safety test does not establish a new baseline. Duplicate and older frames retain the existing `lastFrameValid=true` skip convention; they are counted separately by `skippedDuplicateFrameCount` and `skippedOutOfOrderFrameCount` and have a descriptive `lastError` status. They do not parse or dispatch payload messages, even if speculative byte decoding/readback has already completed.

For `W=256`: `100 -> 101 -> 100` skips the final 100; `255 -> 0` skips zero; `256 -> 0 -> 1` accepts the restart and continuation. `4294967295 -> 0` is a normal forward wrap regardless of the window. With `W=512`, `256 -> 0` is skipped. The window is a frame-count threshold, not a time interval, a sliding replay cache or a group of stored textures.

This is deliberately a heuristic without a session ID. A delayed old zero can trigger a false restart; a restart that loses frame zero or occurs before one window has elapsed is not recognized by this exception. After an accepted reset, sufficiently high old frames can again appear newer. Changing streams accepts the candidate and replaces the baseline after successful application; no history of retired streams is retained. RPC event deduplication is unchanged and is not cleared by this heuristic. Disabling `skipDuplicateFrames` bypasses both ordering checks and the restart rule, useful for intentional recorded-video seeking but allowing old variable values to be applied.

### Datagram compatibility

The datagram and protocol version are **unchanged**. The header is still 56 bytes and the payload format is unchanged. `StreamId` occupies bytes `20..23` (UInt32 little-endian), `FrameIndex` bytes `24..27` (UInt32 little-endian), and `TimestampMs` bytes `28..31` (UInt32 little-endian, not used by this rule). Reserved bytes `44..49` remain zero. Header CRC32 remains at `52..55` over bytes `0..51`. Neither the window size nor a session ID is transmitted. See the [frame layout](../concepts/protocol.md) for the remaining fields. Existing senders require no change; the receiver's frame-admission policy changes.

## `ResetDecodeDiagnostics()`

```csharp
public void ResetDecodeDiagnostics()
```

Resets the error-log budget, predicted-readback/fallback/combined-output counters and busy-capture counter. It does not cancel pending slots or reset the existing frame/RPC counters or the last-applied stream/frame used by the ordering rules.

## Diagnostics

| Member | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `lastFrameValid` | Last frame passed all decode stages. |
| `lastHeaderValid` | Header was valid before payload decode. |
| `lastError` | Last decoder error or warning text. |
| `lastNetworkMessageCount` | Number of messages found in the decoded network frame. |
| `lastAppliedVariableCount` | Number of variables applied to behaviours. |
| `lastRpcCallCount` | Number of RPC messages dispatched. |
| `lastCodecId` | Codec ID read from the last valid header. |
| `lastFrameIndex` | Frame index read from the header. |
| `lastPayloadBytes` | Payload byte count used by the decoder. |

## Binding application

The decoder uses binding arrays generated by `TSMPSetup`. Each binding maps:

- `networkId`
- `variableHash`
- value type
- target behaviour
- target field name
- sync direction

When a variable message arrives, the decoder only applies it to matching bindings. When an RPC message arrives, the decoder dispatches it to the matching `TSMPNetworkBehaviour`.

## Runtime rules

- A frame with a valid header but unknown codec ID is ignored.
- `ReceiveInterpolation.None` on a target behaviour means received values are ignored for that behaviour.
- RPC calls are event-like. Use repeat frames on the encoder if the transport drops frames.
- Decoder logs important runtime failures because inspector fields are not visible in uploaded worlds.
